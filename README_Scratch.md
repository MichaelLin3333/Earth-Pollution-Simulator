Below is a detailed, step-by-step developer guide for creating an **Earth Pollution Simulation** project using Scratch. This guide is tailored for beginners and outlines how to use Scratch’s visual programming environment to simulate pollution spread, add interactive elements, and present an Earth Day theme.

## **Step 1: Setting Up the Scratch Environment**

### **1.1. Access Scratch**
- **Online or Offline:**  
  Visit [Scratch’s website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) or download the Scratch Desktop application if you prefer offline work.
- **Sign In (Optional):**  
  Create an account or sign in to save and share your project.

### **1.2. Create a New Project**
- On the Scratch homepage, click **“Create”** to start a new project.
- Familiarize yourself with the Scratch interface, including the stage, sprites list, and blocks palette.

## **Step 2: Designing the Simulation Environment**

### **2.1. Setting the Background**
- **Choose a Background:**  
  - In the Stage area, click on the “Choose a Backdrop” button.  
  - Select a backdrop that represents the Earth or a nature scene. You can also paint your own if desired.
- **Customize the Backdrop:**  
  - Use the Backdrop Editor to add elements like clouds or a city skyline that hint at pollution sources.

### **2.2. Creating Pollution-Related Sprites**
- **Pollution Source Sprite:**  
  - Create or import a sprite that represents a pollution source (e.g., a factory, car, or smokestack).
  - To import, click “Choose a Sprite” and search or upload an image.
- **Pollution Particle Sprite:**  
  - Create a small sprite that represents a “pollution particle.” This can be a simple colored circle.
  - Optionally, design multiple particles with varying sizes or colors to represent different pollution intensities.

## **Step 3: Programming the Pollution Simulation**

### **3.1. Setting Up Variables**
- **Create Variables:**  
  - Go to the “Variables” tab and create a variable called `Pollution Level` to keep track of overall pollution intensity.
  - You might also create a variable like `Diffusion Rate` if you want to allow user control over how quickly pollution spreads.

### **3.2. Simulating Pollution Emission**
- **Factory/Car Script:**  
  - For the pollution source sprite, use a loop to continuously broadcast a message like `emit pollution` at regular intervals.
  - Example blocks for the source sprite:
    - **Event:** When green flag clicked.
    - **Control:** Forever loop.
    - **Broadcast:** Send message `emit pollution` every few seconds (use a `wait` block for timing).
  - Increase `Pollution Level` by a fixed amount each time a pollution source emits pollution.
  ```scratch
  when green flag clicked
  forever
      broadcast [emit pollution v]
      change [Pollution Level v] by (5)
      wait (2) seconds
  end
  ```
  
### **3.3. Creating the Diffusion Effect**
- **Pollution Particle Script:**  
  - For the pollution particle sprite, set up a script that responds to the `emit pollution` broadcast.
  - When the sprite receives the message:
    - **Clone the Sprite:** Create a clone of the pollution particle.
    - **Movement:** Make the clone move in a random direction to simulate diffusion.
    - **Fade Out:** Gradually change the ghost effect (transparency) to simulate dissipation.
  - Example blocks for the particle sprite:
  ```scratch
  when I start as a clone
  go to [pollution source v] // Position at the source
  point in direction (pick random (0) to (360))
  repeat (50)
      move (5) steps
      change ghost effect by (5)
      wait (0.1) seconds
  end
  delete this clone
  ```
  *Explanation:*  
  The particle sprite clones itself each time a pollution emission occurs, moves randomly, and fades out to simulate the spread and dissipation of pollutants.

### **3.4. Visualizing Pollution Level on Stage**
- **Display the Pollution Level:**  
  - Use the variable monitor on the stage to display the current `Pollution Level`.
  - Optionally, add a sprite (like a thermometer or gauge) that visually reflects the pollution level by changing its costume or size as the variable increases.

Below is a guide on how to incorporate real-world elements into both the Python and Scratch versions of your Earth Pollution projects. In both cases, you can enrich your simulation with data and visuals that reflect actual global and regional pollution information.
Scratch does not support direct API calls, but you can still embed real-world elements by integrating static data and visuals.

### **3.5. Using Real-World Visuals**

- **Import Backgrounds and Sprites:**  
  - **Global/Regional Maps:** Import a high-quality backdrop image of a world map or a regional map. You might take a screenshot of a map showing pollution data (from public resources) and upload it to Scratch.
  - **Pollution Data Charts:** Create or import charts and infographics showing real-world pollution levels.
  
- **How to Import:**
  - Click on the “Choose a Backdrop” button and upload your image.
  - Use the “Choose a Sprite” option to import additional graphics (e.g., pollution icons, statistics).

### **3.6. Integrating Pre-Loaded Data**

- **Using Variables and Lists:**  
  Since you cannot fetch data live, you can manually input regional data.
  - **Create a List:**  
    Create a list called “City Data” or “Pollution Stats” containing key numbers (e.g., PM2.5 levels for major cities).
  - **Interactive Prompts:**  
    Use the “ask [Which region?] and wait” block to let users select a region. Then, based on their input, display the corresponding pre-loaded data.
  - **Example Script:**
    ```scratch
    when green flag clicked
    ask [Enter a region (e.g., Asia, Europe, North America)] and wait
    if <(answer) = [Asia]> then
       say [PM2.5 level in Asia is 80 µg/m³] for (2) secs
    else
       if <(answer) = [Europe]> then
          say [PM2.5 level in Europe is 35 µg/m³] for (2) secs
       else
          say [Data not available] for (2) secs
       end
    end
    ```
    *Explanation:*  
    This script uses a simple conditional check to show pre-defined pollution data. You can expand the script by adding more regions and corresponding information.

### **3.7. Adding Interactive Educational Elements**

- **Interactive Quizzes or Facts:**  
  Create additional sprites that, when clicked, share interesting facts about regional and global pollution. For example:
  - A sprite might display: “In Los Angeles, real-time data shows that PM2.5 levels often exceed safe limits during wildfires.”
  
- **Using Broadcasts:**  
  Use broadcast messages to switch between different scenes or data sets to simulate real-world scenarios.

By integrating real-world elements into your Scratch projects, you not only enhance the realism and educational value of your Earth Pollution simulation but also provide your audience with a tangible connection to global and regional issues. These enhancements can include live data feeds, real-world maps, or pre-loaded statistics that illustrate current environmental challenges.

## **Step 4: Adding Interactivity and Final Touches**

### **4.1. User Interaction**
- **Interactive Controls:**  
  - Create buttons using sprites that allow users to adjust the `Diffusion Rate` or temporarily reduce the `Pollution Level` (e.g., “Clean Up” button).
  - Example for a “Clean Up” button script:
  ```scratch
  when this sprite clicked
  change [Pollution Level v] by (-20)
  ```
- **Dynamic Simulation Adjustments:**  
  - Use additional broadcasts (e.g., `increase diffusion`) to allow users to simulate effects like wind or rain that alter pollution diffusion.
  
### **4.2. Testing and Debugging**
- **Run the Simulation:**  
  - Click the green flag to start the simulation.
  - Monitor the pollution level and particle behaviors to ensure they work as expected.
- **Debugging Tips:**  
  - Use the “See Inside” mode to check scripts.
  - Test one element at a time (e.g., verify that the pollution source correctly emits particles before adding interactivity).

### **4.3. Final Presentation Enhancements**
- **Design Polish:**  
  - Refine the backgrounds and sprite costumes.
  - Add text labels and instructions directly on the stage to guide exhibition visitors.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Prepare a brief explanation on how the simulation models pollution emission and diffusion. This will help explain the project’s educational purpose during the Earth Day exhibition.
